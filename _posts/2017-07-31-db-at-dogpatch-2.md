  title: Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Neural Machine Translation
  description: This talk will provide an introduction to neural networks and how they
    are used for machine translation and concludes with some discussion on the current
    research challenges being addressed by neural machine translation (NMT) research.
    The primary goal of this talk is to give a no-tears easy to understand introduction
    to NMT.

  title: 'Magnets for Sarcasm: Making Sarcasm Detection Timely, Contextual and Very
    Personal'
  description: Sarcasm is a pervasive phenomenon in social media, permitting the concise
    communication of meaning, affect and attitude. Concision requires wit to produce
    and wit to understand, which demands from each party knowledge of norms, context
    and a speaker's mindset. Insight into a speaker's psychological profile at the
    time of production is a valuable source of context for sarcasm detection. Using
    a neural architecture, we show significant gains in detection accuracy when knowledge
    of the speaker's mood at the time of production can be inferred.

 Thanks to Deutsche Bank, Ray and the team, for sponsoring our July events.
 We were back at Dogpatch Labs, this time in the urban gardens.
