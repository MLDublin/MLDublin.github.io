Magnets for Sarcasm: Making Sarcasm Detection Timely, Contextual and Very Personal

> Sarcasm is a pervasive phenomenon in social media, permitting the concise communication of meaning, affect and attitude. Concision requires wit to produce and wit to understand, which demands from each party knowledge of norms, context and a speaker's mindset. Insight into a speaker's psychological profile at the time of production is a valuable source of context for sarcasm detection. Using a neural architecture, we show significant gains in detection accuracy when knowledge of the speaker's mood at the time of production can be inferred.
