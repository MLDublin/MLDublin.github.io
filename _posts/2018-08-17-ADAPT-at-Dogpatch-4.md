  title: "AI + News: Learning to Predict the Global Risks Interconnections from the Web"
  description: We envision a future where journalists will no longer be limited to report pastor current affairs, but they will be empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)to write about future events with a fair degree of certainty.In this talk we present "Minerva", a tool to predict and visualize the (non-obvious) interconnections of global risks that will be at the core of tomorrow's news. We describe how Minerva leverages news data collections available in the Web and applies AI/ML to discover the multiple-relations among global risks. Minerva's data-driven approach is more appealing, in terms of timeliness and efficient discovery of global risks relations, than current annual reports based on opinion surveys offered by the World Economic Forum.
