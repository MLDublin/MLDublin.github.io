  title: Ground-based Image Analysis for Solar Energy Applications
  description: Ground-based sky cameras (popularly known as whole sky imagers) are
    now widely used by remote sensing analysts for understanding the earth’s atmosphere.
    In this work, we use high-resolution sky cameras, to accurately estimate the total
    solar irradiance falling on the earth’s surface. We also use such sequence of
    images to estimate cloud motion fields, and thereby predict future locations of
    cloud with a lead time of a few minutes. Such machine-learning based estimation
    and forecasting techniques can greatly benefit the field of solar energy generation
    and forecasting.

  title: The Cultured Machine
  description: Digital Humanities is a cross disciplinary field in which computer
    scientists and humanities scholars work together to solve problems which are complementary
    to both domains. This talk will describe some of the problems faced in Digital
    Humanities from the perspective of a computer scientist and the various solutions
    which have emerged to handle the vast, complex, messy collections of data which
    document our cultural history.
