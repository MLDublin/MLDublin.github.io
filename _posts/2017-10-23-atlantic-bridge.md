  title: Accelerating progress in robotics through competitions
  description: The space race was the first major engineering competition of the modern
    age; it resulted in massive technical progress and it made science accessible
    to the masses. In efforts to push the state of the art in robotics, its proposed
    that similarly inspired competitions offer a compelling way to advance the field.
    This talk will explore the important role that competitions are playing in modern
    robotics research, and will review progress being made to develop a competitive
    team here in Ireland.

For #19 we organised the event with Atlantic Bridge Ventures. We covered how NLP is made approachable for industry by AYLIEN, neural machine translation for Farsi and morphologically rich langauges, an intor to PyTorch, and look into the world of robotics competitions.
