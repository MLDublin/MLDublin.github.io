  title: The Potential of Recommender-Systems at Macro- and Micro Level
  description: We introduce the concept of a “macro recommender system”, and “micro recommender system” respectively. Both systems can be considered as recommender systems for recommendation algorithms. A macro recommender system recommends the potentially best performing recommendation algorithm to an organization that wants to build a recommender system. This way, an organization does not need to test dozens or even more algorithms to find the best one for their particular platform. A micro recommender system recommends the potentially best-performing algorithm for each individual recommendation request. This concept is based on the premise that there is no single-best algorithm for all type of users, items, and contexts.
