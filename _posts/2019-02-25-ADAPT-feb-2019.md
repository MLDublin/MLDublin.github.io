  title: Quantification of Mutual Understanding?
  description: Natural language interactions through speech interfaces are on the rise, yet face challenges that will require a mixture of computational techniques (machine learning) and human behaviour theories (psychology and cognitive science). At the crossing of these domains, this talk is concerned with the quantification of mutual understanding in dialogues and communicative assessments methods.
