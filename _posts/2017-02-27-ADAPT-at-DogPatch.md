  title: 'Turn Your Photograph into a Painting: the Power of Machine Learning'
  description: 'Painting style transfer is very popular nowadays. The idea is relatively
    simple: you provide a machine with a photograph and the machine paints it for
    you. While this works well with generic scenes such as landscapes, it is very
    challenging when dealing with selfies and head portraits. In this talk, Dr Ahmed
    Selim from the CONNECT Centre in Trinity College Dublin will present a machine
    learning technique for style transfer that specializes in head portraits. The
    technique uses deep learning models to combine information about the identity
    of an individual with information from the style of an artist to produce a faithful
    head portrait.'

  title: Structured Search for World2Seq
  description: The goal of many Machine Learning tasks is to output a sequence of
    symbols. In many cases we actually know things about the output domain that could
    guide the search for optimal output, but this information can be difficult to
    incorporate at training time. In this talk, I'll discuss my recent work on structured
    search for models that output sequences, and propose a general method for constraining
    search when it makes sense to do so.
