   title: A big data approach to predict autoimmune disease flare using environmental and clinical interactions
   description: ANCA vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disease, whose ‘flares’ can result in rapid kidney impairment and destruction of other organs. Flares cannot currently be predicted with accuracy. Epidemiological data support a strong environmental impact on flare risk, though it is unclear which factors are most relevant. We are using an unbiased big data approach in an attempt to define the ‘signature’ of the disease’s relapse. Environmental factors, such as infectious disease rates, weather and pollution, will be matched with patients’ locations, recorded by an app that we have developed. Clinical and biobank data will also be incorporated using semantic web approaches.
